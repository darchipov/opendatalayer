# Unsorted TODO list (while missing an issue tracker)

## mandatory
- implement method queue API handling in odl/ODL
- improve functional tests
- port all functional tests from DAL to ODL
- remove ODL.collectIdentityDataFromCookies and add ODL.addData to be able to set identity data from outside the core
- move metaData stuff from odl/ODL to odl/lib/utils
- stabilize ODL builder

## nice-to-have
- port ODL core to Promise-driven API
- (?) port everything back to ES5 to reduce complexity and get rid of babel boilerplate code
