# Unsorted TODO list (while missing an issue tracker)

## mandatory
- improve functional tests
- port all functional tests from DAL to ODL
- remove ODL.collectIdentityDataFromCookies and add ODL.addData to be able to set identity data from outside the core
- stabilize ODL builder
- test real-world usecase of builder (i.e. when included as npm dependency)

## nice-to-have
- port ODL core to Promise-driven API
- (?) port everything back to ES5 to reduce complexity and get rid of babel boilerplate code
