# Unsorted TODO list (while missing an issue tracker)

## mandatory
- add cookie.js tests
- add functional test setup based on fixture.html (testcafe?)
- implement method queue API handling in odl/ODL
- move metaData stuff from odl/ODL to odl/lib/utils
- port all functional tests from DAL to ODL
- port ODL core to Promise-driven API
- remove ODL.collectIdentityDataFromCookies and add ODL.addData to be able to set identity data from outside the core

## nice-to-have
- (?) port everything back to ES5 to reduce complexity and get rid of babel boilerplate code
